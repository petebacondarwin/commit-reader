# Angular Committers

To run the web app just start a web-server in the root of the project

```bash
npm install -g http-server
http-server
```

Then navigate to the app folder

```
http://localhost:8080/app
```


## Generating the data

There are three nodeJS tools:

* node **scrape-gh.js** angular angular.js {user} {password}

This tool will iterate over all the commits in a GitHub repository and dump the output into a JSON file.
To get around the GH API rate limiting you need to provide valid login credentials

* node **download-avatars.js** commitFile imageFolder

This tool takes the JSON file generated by scrape-gh.js and downloads each author's avatar image into the specified folder

* node **process-commit-data.js** inputFile.json outputFile.json

This tool cleans up the file created by the scrape-gh.js file for use in the app.
